# DBT Knowledge Base - Fixed! âœ…

## Changes Made

### 1. **Created JSON Version of DBT Knowledge Base**
   - Created `data/dbt-knowledge.json` - A properly structured JSON file that the AI can easily read
   - Contains all DBT skills, exercises, therapeutic notes, and crisis keywords
   - Structured data for 5 main modules:
     - Mindfulness
     - Stress Tolerance
     - Emotion Regulation
     - Interpersonal Effectiveness
     - Trauma-Specific Skills

### 2. **Updated dbtService.js**
   - Changed to load from JSON: `require("../data/dbt-knowledge.json")`
   - Added validation to ensure knowledge base loads properly
   - Added console logging to confirm successful loading

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - **server.js**: Added robust null/undefined checks for chat responses
   - **app.js (frontend)**: Added validation for response structure before accessing nested properties
   - Now gracefully handles invalid responses instead of crashing

### 4. **Created Missing JSON Files**
   - `data/personalityQuestions.json` - Big Five personality assessment questions
   - `data/screenings.json` - GAD-7 (anxiety) and PHQ-9 (depression) screening info
