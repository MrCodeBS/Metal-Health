# Setup Complete âœ…

## What's Working

### 1. **Server Status** âœ…
- Node.js server running on http://127.0.0.1:3000
- MongoDB Atlas connected successfully
- All endpoints functional

### 2. **Apple Health Integration** âœ…
The app now supports importing Apple Health data to correlate physical health metrics with mental health tracking:

#### Features Implemented:
- **File Upload**: Upload Apple Health export ZIP files
- **Data Parsing**: Automatically extracts:
  - Sleep hours
  - Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - stress indicator
  - Resting heart rate
  - Daily steps
  - Exercise minutes
  - Mindfulness minutes
- **Data Storage**: Health metrics saved to MongoDB with date indexing
- **Health Summary**: View 30-day averages of all health metrics
- **Correlation Analysis**: See how sleep, HRV, and exercise correlate with mood entries
- **Insights Generation**: AI-generated insights about sleep quality, stress levels, and exercise patterns

#### How to Use:
1. Open iPhone Health app
2. Tap profile icon â†’ Export All Health Data
3. Share the ZIP file to yourself (email/airdrop)
4. In the web app, scroll to "Apple Health Integration" card
5. Click "Choose File" and select the exported ZIP
6. Click "Upload Health Data"
7. Click "View Summary" to see your health metrics and insights

### 3. **MongoDB Connection** âœ…
- Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas
- Database: `mindbot` on cluster `mental-data.le2zkbz.mongodb.net`
- All user data, mood entries, and health data are being saved

### 4. **Chat & DBT Skills** âœ…
- AI chat working with Groq API
- DBT knowledge base loaded successfully
- All 5 skill modules available:
  - Mindfulness
  - Stress Tolerance
  - Emotion Regulation
  - Interpersonal
  - Trauma-Specific

## Technical Stack

### Core:
- Node.js v22.16.0 + Express
- MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
- Groq API (Llama 3.1-8b-instant)

### Apple Health Integration:
- **multer** - File upload handling
- **xml2js** - XML parsing
- **adm-zip** - ZIP extraction
- Custom parser service (`services/appleHealthService.js`)

### New Files Created:
- `models/HealthData.js` - MongoDB schema for health metrics
- `services/appleHealthService.js` - Apple Health XML parser
- `APPLE-HEALTH-INTEGRATION.md` - Developer documentation
- `APPLE-HEALTH-USER-GUIDE.md` - User instructions
- `APPLE-HEALTH-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical specs

## API Endpoints

### Apple Health Endpoints:
```
POST /api/health/upload
- Upload Apple Health export ZIP
- Requires: Authentication token
- Body: multipart/form-data with 'healthExport' file

GET /api/health/summary?days=30
- Get health metrics summary
- Requires: Authentication token
- Returns: Averages for sleep, HRV, steps, exercise

GET /api/health/correlation?days=30
- Get health-mood correlation data
- Requires: Authentication token
- Returns: Matched health + mood data with insights
```

## What's Next?

### For Users:
1. Export your Apple Health data from your iPhone
2. Upload it to the app
3. Check your health summary and see correlations with your mood
4. Use the insights to improve your sleep, exercise, and stress management

### For Developers:
- All documentation is in the markdown files
- Check `APPLE-HEALTH-INTEGRATION.md` for technical details
- The parser supports extensibility for additional health metrics

## Free Solution âœ…
As requested, this implementation uses **zero paid APIs**:
- Apple Health data export is built into iOS (free)
- XML parsing uses open-source libraries
- No health API subscriptions required
- All processing happens on your server

## MongoDB Atlas Note
Your MongoDB Atlas connection is working! If you experience connection issues in the future:
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Navigate to Network Access
3. Ensure your current IP is whitelisted (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for access from anywhere)
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
